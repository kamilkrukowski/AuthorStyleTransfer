under the of the same sacred profession they are all

some time he desires me to tell you that the 
possibility of happiness as these were the best of her 
clever this is the only point i flatter myself on 
the faults she once had you are the only being 
to the wronged uncle and am thankful to reflect that 
come to see you i hope you will have it 
herself gallant but it had passed as his way â 
needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what 
and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency 
nothing worth hearing â looked without seeing â admired without 
most and acquaintance and so lost the woman whom he 
this nest of comforts now walked down to try its 
a stone s throw to my fancy a thousand times 
such wish him well what do you imagine his age 
you and now what shall we do i thought to 
mother must be asked as his mother was to a 
up for ever and my aunt is sure it would 
she knows her own worth too well for false shame 
to take leave and was then most agreeably sur abbey 
representatives or idle heir who were at the command of

them the night was stormy the wind had been rising 
when did she judge amiss the abbey would be always

with them after her husband the de had been and 
and less of your daughter she is not of a

deference to her father contrasted with his former language was 
anybody else the he seems to have most engaging manners 
recovered enough to feel that s e could not regret

a few moments she hardly supposed there was anything worse 
old ground again took the subject from his friend as 
be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john

to think of her ever going amongst them again even

a trifling sacrifice our ball was rather more amusing than

been shout y â she knelt in spirit to her 
coming mr johnson leaves london next tuesday he is going 
was several days before s name was mentioned before by 
from london on wednesday i received one copy sent down 
had her to dispose it for some at last however 
body s joy for granted or he might not have 
the party probably as she says herself from having been

known all this i should have had no confidence no 
of her being in my favor i wanted her to

most difficult thing mm to hope that them ie would 
wonder or and had her in her own been equal 
left her nothing to do instead of being sent for

which the favourite volume always opened â ov hall walter

needs more lessons than a weekly sermon convey and that 
think of me as i appeared then was a word 
cards she could not be wanted to her mother s 
as one who had never thought on the enough to 
it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but 
and miss has been persuaded to spend the day with 
some people even talked of a promise to his wife 
ought i was very young and associated only with the

of girls and i think the attention is due to

having a ball talked of which never took place i

entered the room sense and sensibility none at all ma 
a head and therefore very leisure was ever given for 
noise or re park treat from it to the of 
her not one fell to the share of miss whom 
had all reached the gate of exit the carriage advancing 
could have wished that something might be acted for she 
a point of some dignity as well as some convenience

a little patience and a little impatience a judicious mixture 
had put himself in the power of feelings on her 
very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you this 
ay ay i see how it will be said sir 
his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed 
for more company they added to their house to their 
busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with

to hear miss whom he was much disposed to admire 
in these sort of hopes her uncle was soon after

though she could not previously have of a syllable at

a taste for the biography and which she delighted in

he had done for them all and acknowledge tlie advantages

he really and for a moment or two looking with 
he is to attach himself to such a creature â 
and if the child had not called her to come 
at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it 
too came at last but did not live to know 
nothing in her situation likely to engage their father s 
talks of going to oxford soon said she but now

miss about it nay cried mrs i am sure i

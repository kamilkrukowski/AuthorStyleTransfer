nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he

to finish the four sitting rooms the rest is deferred till the spring is more 
should never want of spirit from captain s manners i thought them particularly pleasing and 
the calmness of her own dressing room in the impartial flow of her own meditations 
at once that his stay at was necessary to herself that she should want him 
she really felt â but when she saw how much she had pained edward her 
tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet fig i cut what 
they would be very glad to do and the consequence was that strange as it 
was extremely confused she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though 
or with without skill to make them better and v f or indulging them without

he wanted her so very much to see the before she went out of harbour

after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying â does your sister make 
with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of 
kindest welcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not stand against such a reception 
if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in

sensible woman â it is putting it into his head we should like a few 
agony about him and then the poor horses too to see them straining away you 
improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring we shall be

his arrival came as soon as possible and scarcely ten days had passed since had 
fifteen and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles 
and it is impossible to help wishing the news could have been suppressed for just 
in themselves perhaps however the distinction between keeping true to nature and any one specimen 
almost all that she had seen and heard astonished at miss and angry with mr 
a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy as to the nature of her 
obliged it was miss whose kind exertions were to excite â ci with a ow 
i will see that there are sir said frank to his father miss must not 
him afterwards as he sat near e leaning over it folded arms and face concealed 
last week and are could sit it no longer she almost ran out of the 
wife one only could profit by the kindness of their friends miss the who was 
corner of the sofa the picture of health wealth ease and tranquillity was just falling 
and birth was spoken of as an intruder she was in every thing considered and 
languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something 
light such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat young and 
to be so easily filled up with us replied turning away to the fire where 
to her mother why do you not ask at once said she whether she is

genius etc mr st and both talk in character and very well in some former 
without finding food tor a rambling fancy to say the truth replied miss i am 
of finding him still with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless 
the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own 
language could be suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed capable of departing 
i should not like so well as when you receive this our guests will be 
tool on but the letter mr your own letter â have you anything to say 
waa at leaf t a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition totally from 
i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport 
his their box she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in 
and all in happy enjoyment of the future the party did not break up without 
eight and twenty i was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her 
at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having most dreadfully to youth 
eye miss is to be i should not have thought it the sort of play 
serious one indeed when she is really recovered she ought to try change of air

nourishment to the fruit which in fact cannot attain its full maturity and flavor without 
was acted upon chaise was sent for from and charles back a far more useful 
herself said that tuesday would suit her as well it was quite ridiculous quite absurd 
minute every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off for instantly either

any other man upon ray soul he added i believe it is nothing more and 
gained everything relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be and 
a second marriage they were young people of fortune the son had a good estate

as her and missed no c of projecting among all the young people of her

more for a wet evening in my li yon mast manage well as you can 
his entrance she walked across the room to the tea table where presided and whispered 
any of that displeasure which maria had he en half prepared for thus much was 
charity though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the 
other for the last fifteen years compliments on good looks now passed and after observing 
alas poor thou game what now thine empty name where now thy more distinguished fame 
unfolded was an insult not to be overlooked nor for the first half hour to 
spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more 
what manner he expressed himself and how he was received need not be particularly told 
a comfort and with leave to take was altogether such a combination of blessings as 
her prosperity too he should not have to think of her as in the retirement 
place altogether i have been very but are you now at leisure to satisfy me 
and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good fail in the part simplicity indeed is 
f in and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr s carriage was 
longed to have them roused aa soon as possible the remonstrance which would certainly â 
daughters had already felt and said of a dis appointment hardly less painful than s 
her own a house of her own â but where is the advantage of a 
unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in

a very few days were enough to effect this and at the end of those 
preparation at the removal of everything to the play he left the house in all 
walk and going into the east room again the first thing which caught her eye 
the country one mornings soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two 
able to reason away was such a temptation to as nothing could have conquered but 
was no to the regard of colonel she saw it with concern for what could 
marry mr s sister as by s account she would make him abundantly regret what 
said when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates â now mr do let me 
a fellow perhaps as any in the world you must not judge of him miss 
the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them did 
do and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward and talking and giving your 
parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal 
was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr 
fire you know mr replied mrs i am this moment going to dress said he 
and her inclination for good company and power of what was elegant and clever showed 
hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father 
for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those 
he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself 
to her brother who is one of the post boys i happened to look up 
should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could 
about me a little and settle my matters for it is a long while since 
so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party 
he continued in a lower tone to avoid the possibility of being heard by and 
comes in very naturally you frighten me out of my wits by your reference your

feel the goodness of colonel most sensibly there are not many men who would act 
and he drank he was dirty and gross she had never been able to recall 
children she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having to speak to 
dr grant has done we were always doing as it was it was only the 
you this ought to be a day of my meant it sa oh yes yes 
business you chose to consult the admiral before you made up your mind but this 
was enough to make her interested in the engagement for though she could now meet 
about the key there might have been some excuse but i went the very moment 
my dear miss said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favor 
were would have been worse but for such and that both her mother and were 
be detained at by severe illness confined to your bed perhaps and quite unable to 
be so infinitely dearer to me my than either anne or maria i feel that 
was loud excepting p her mother s which resembled the soft monotony of lady s

three or four shillings than i could have means of bringing home â i cannot 
laugh at me about william but i could quite as ill spare robert martin he 
miss i cannot go this availed nothing the same arguments assailed her again she must 
reply she had not thought her old friend could ban made so indifferent a what 
of her before she is a relation of the my dear a very near relation 
she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight 
spinning or wool this was a better occupation for them than straw inasmuch as it

however the order of release was given and much was then by the general s 
vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to 
no hope of ever being and if i was to part with i should only 
account for his not putting himself forward and mrs probably found the same explanation was 
rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how how

from all danger of seeing again her mother considered her to be at least equally

but i went the very moment she said she wanted it nothing could be more

my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i

a reference to her and to say to myself i shall keep this for aunt 
had only to be grateful and give general assurances but she was now very fully 
respect that is tbe way to spoil had nothing to oppose against such reasoning and 
as to their sister s i think it advisable to say that i believe there 
to her that now lose no time in declaring himself and she was that even 
that i should not wonder at his being delighted with her had he known nothing 
your dear brother not having heard from him since he went to oxford and am 
think again on tbe how could he answer it to himself to rob bis child 
it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far

piece of wit but found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it

temper and manner a very opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased 
with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession 
to anne who saw that captain was all attention looking and listening with his whole

she had only to rise and with mr s very cordial pass quietly away stopping 
quickness of perception in some in the of character a natural penetration in short which

had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr s absence or 
the more for your sake but to day it is really bad enough to make

ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and 
be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry 
living child a girl about jane s age and jane became their guest paying them 
is all over â so by poor mr not seeming to care how he exposed

leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady out of 
the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am 
is right â you could not have started a more happy idea since you will 
nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and in that gallery 
girls indeed which for her was enthusiastic admiration sir john s confidence in his own 
fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them miss ward at 
much too often and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and 
relations suffered severely also jane was well enough to pay several visits with her sister 
so it appears from the growth of the and in general the how beautiful bow 
days passed away from the time of mr s departure and her situation continued with 
about it or perhaps tt â â oc its being a great vi t iy 
very much attached to my brother she has in love with him ever since they 
our weather must not always be judged by the we may sometimes take greater liberties 
come me it ia for your s good that i wish to i have nobody 
same eager then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it but 
his previous habits he was the better forever for his illness he had park and 
i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not be the last 
the general as he moved through the crowd and how handsome a family they are 
now than to can for mr martin or to be suspected of it when had 
could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid 
continue to like mr rush worth that is impossible he must like him less after 
time and anxious to observe the result of it herself she resolved to sit with 
any of us quite overcome poor â he in all yesterday but i would not 
side he had hut one opinion you are to go thank you i am so 
had at one period he had received such an to caution and silence as for 
and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to 
here you know my reasons â propriety and so forth i would urge them more 
for an evening that will be that will be a novelty and a treat tbey 
to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years but 
by s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then 
list of lady s too gentle how anne s more rigid might have been taken 
a answer though doubting her own success but it seemed to satisfy for she directly 
the last and the misery of the girl when he left her luckily the visit 
he seemed to be about four or five and twenty was rather tall had a 
an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr the subject was 
i need not say how rejoiced i shall be to hear there has been any 
was found would be no difference at all so with all the kind and all 
to be throwing you together so well as i knew his tricks but i did 
at any time to see what is it really a castle an old castle the 
me in such a tone oh god â holding out her hand to me asking 
and j ng over ht r in gave more pain to her than could have 
she was a person of whom i have heard well and think so highly that 
heart and say you do not indeed i can both hands and spread them to 
and you shall give me your opinion mr was rather agitated by such harsh reflections 
coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still 
what principally strikes me so much decision of character skilful has been the hand great 
complacency her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach and after being at 
could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her but she had an 
and fear to trust the influence of friends when tom is better i shall go 
the which he entered into while they were standing up of the horses and dogs 
of parliament or large landed proprietor to the young or younger of equally good family 
and i know where he is too yes yes we can guess where he is 
as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such 
of the others and which seemed to say that was mr s choice she knew 
with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage 
with captain if he gave her the opportunity she was persuaded by lady s countenance 
girl miss king is shall know what to think she is a very good kind 
the bearings of the roads the difference of the state k the harvest the cottages 
should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her 
affections with so much and so many and as to excite general attention the letter 
and particularly struck by the alteration in s looks and fix m his ignorance of 
and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the of it were no better 
his great coat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he 
lost his good opinion what was to become of her i am very sorry said 
as can be but there is no vice in him did not think the portrait 
think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years 
know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming 
had received him a look a speech a removal from one chair u another a 
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure every thing but which had 
known mrs and the two miss al in bath whither they had removed it seems 
more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at yes i 
building in which n takes m for better for worse grieved that she could not 
i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as 
and pray let know in private that i think she is quite right to work 
do away former objection to their living together but even to give it the moat 
opening of the door brought something more welcome it was for the tea things which 
his advancing in it here in an ecstasy of indignation clapped her hands together and 
like theirs only brothers and sisters and intimate friends and which would never be heard 
her cousin if he would have walked by her side all the way lo place 
plague his heart out and so i shall always say my dear you may depend 
time first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though was 
bred t man i am sure you will not like him there we differ said 
we are expecting a brother of mrs s here soon i dare say you know 
named who have for more than a century it together with the chief farm in 
they can do no good you must now come downstairs with me mr has been 
an altered creature indifferent to everything that passed the being left with her and nephew 
into an invitation to remain at for the present elizabeth most consented and a servant 
every thing that had been wont to interest her a letter from one belonging to 
in you what â not merely beyond what one one never ter anything like it 
him who was now master of the house and who having so much leisure as 
henry ha k c b v ft b l w list up si a flower 
as strong as her tf and with a mind tormented by self reproach which must 
was as steady as her words that you may have less difficulty in believing this 
it i vows i believe said to her aunt will be to evening and that

than twenty and it would be a help to the young people in their journey 
head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done that 
was that he should ever meet with such another woman before it began to strike 
sister need not any scruple even of visiting tier which to say the truth has 
heard enough in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from fall of 
common will reach the age of sixteen without her name as far as she can 
answer but he being entirely without particular regard for either without jealousy either in love 
to attend the second it is more than they deserve for in fact they add 
say nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on 
i repeated edward but why must you have hunters i everybody does not coloured as 
take up the volume which had been left on the table and begin to herself 
mrs s exertions as a nurse she really left nothing for mary to do he 
her the object of a coarse joke her disappointment in her mother was greater there 
think about them â and she would not think about them any longer but no 
her it appeared most at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being 
she could do justice to tlie sup of ru â ell s in this over 
had settled with mrs not to go to her till after a much better time 
a remarkably pretty figure was still her form though not so correct as her sister 
it must be a match â that they were over head and ears in love 
and she wished to show john by this pointed invitation to ber how totally disregarded 
short time as soon as the variety of before him was arranged and he knew 
it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what 
bo the scenes and characters of which they treat are so entirely that it is 
you but you are now the only one i can apply to for the truth 
be occupied in fears for the the miss were now fully established among the of 
for some of those evils as she now sat looking at she could not but 
more did not see the necessity of it by any farther assertion and when called 
no occasion for putting captain off and only be sorry to think that the cottage 
was the which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up 
charles but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in 
and left the room this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening she was 
eye clear brown complexion and general had she been tall full formed and fair it 
it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like 
manner in the world in the of my mother s spectacles the came out you 
in their and she soon found out that of all dresses a was the must 
the being at home as i should not have a place to go to in 
my dearest i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have 
than when you know that i am in town an of hither though with mrs 
less wild and more open a long stretch of the road which they had travelled 
those who loved her best such a home indeed such an aunt said as she 
all his tender feelings i suppose on this distressing occasion she has been talking a 
of her companions pleased to find more comfortably in that particular than she had e 
oh mr do not mistake me is no fine lady i assure you do not 
our and horses are so extremely i believe we drive faster than what a pleasure 
at s picture or those of the dutch school must admit that excellence of imitation 
remembers to to that is exactly what i think of him cried do dot of 
not pleasures for me â oh yes i must be there i could not refuse 
in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome had 
it tour poor mother too on but the letter mr your own letter â have 
the delightful of spirits i was then in would undergo so speedy so melancholy a 
days had preferred her to and when the news of her death had at last 
writing and standing with his back towards mrs he drew out a letter from under 
a little uncomfortable in the thought of all that was to them her conversation with 
things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what 
before seeking to ally himself to a family of which the mother is vulgar and 
me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to 
the pleasure of my taste but i always delight in those kinds of and a 
which had recently entered it for a short time he sat deep in thought after 
been never farther from peace she could not feel that she had done wrong herself 
it must and gravely glancing at mr there is a fine old saying which everybody 
i must you cried jane my dear dear i would i do congratulate you but 
the experience of the past to submit and therefore after such an delay as she 
and many a young lady went to that night wi her head full of happy

so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other

it is now in its state but i do not suppose have you never been

she feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust nay almost unkind to her 
voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal and an

she had been struggling for at least two years she yet feared that her sister 
â her own happy and gentle but what could i do we were engaged everything 
together in the drawing room it was just the plan to suit and with a 
of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an boast and which 
to myself on that head you bid me be on your mend s account and 
an occasion said miss calmly would be mr i imagine that is what i was 
and whether helping or or indulging them without any power of engaging their respect of

so saying she walked hastily out of the room leaving awkward feelings to more than 
opened the door and called out â my dear i want to speak with you

to wait for enjoyment until there is real opportunity for it mary behaved very well

lady let this pass and only said in i own that to be able to

caresses followed this confession in such a frame of mind as she was now in

to her this was too much you are mistaken said she warmly in supposing i 
of and by way of i am now come to take mj farewell of ou 
after to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to 
your footsteps took the volume let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to 
no and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish sense and sensibility as 
secret meditations and nothing was more to her than to find her aunt using the 
a personage who appears but seldom in the story he is represented as a sensible 
however at last and the evening set in with more composure to and cheerfulness of 
following letter to mr â â i must take the liberty of asking you a 
necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home has a great desire

fidelity and a dexterity and perfection on her was bestowed though in a humble form

which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing 
not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some 
from the nature of her malady and feeling herself universally ill could no longer hope 
and leave you to guess what you like i have no news for you you 
it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on s mind it would produce 
own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing 
and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common 
at seven o clock leaving still sweetly asleep she joined mrs in the drawing sense 
a visit nobody at home seemed to want her but william soon after her removal 
deal of kind pleasure was expressed in her having enjoyed the evening so much and

so for young people as a long engagement it is what i s protested against 
more of such looks and speeches his cold politeness his grace were worse than anything 
on her in my present visit in short it ended in a total breach by 
a in spite of every long standing expectation and she was obliged to repeat again 
much reason to suppose was at and left alone to bear the worrying of mrs 
l war if a admiral were to come in our way sir walter i he 
if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have 
short and pleasant had been the meal after seeing william to the last moment walked 
was so gentle frank and even affectionate that if i had not known how much 
to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others 
this money and frank s promotion i shall never forgive you letters of jane mrs 
such a journey to think of any thing else sir thomas approved of it for 
from mr that will be a favor indeed for i know gentlemen do not like 
forgotten the friends who had done ao much â the dear dear friends i but 
her affection neither has she any of that brilliancy of intellect that genius or vigor

that moment about her and she was not to be kept away from her sister

of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid

to go by them too without saying a word you i know how vexed i

justly than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led was only 
many years to be well received by them in a worldly view he had nothing 
past as unfortunate in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction 
nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed 
and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most s life of scott

the very same neighborhood â lives only four miles from grove jane will be only 
of to them the little and which had at first made grievous on the tranquillity

your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i 
any inferior common place situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or 
at it will be best however as it is anne has just given her mistress 
to little edward to aunt james and uncle james and he hopes all your and 
to look well with all her advantages brought up in this family as she has 
speculation and they have so far the same in he fancies that she feels like 
interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still

and after stopping to look about her and seemingly to all that had then passed 
her friend could be at was beyond her comprehension could not be aware of the

the and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to 
it silenced her she felt how would be if her aunt s feelings were against 
decided taste i am sure he encouraged it in us as how many a time 
with a mind very differently influenced and therefore watching to veiy different effect saw nothing 
he really to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must bâ forgiven for having

being altogether completely agreeable it was a bold for he was s brother and she

been following him almost into the drawing room mrs felt herself of an office on 
her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed i could hardly

particular request for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for her 
without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without her spirits too 
mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be 
him to declare himself in his true colours altogether she is an character and the 
in it a room or two can easily be and if my friends find no 
very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than 
most natural its probability and its have really so equalled each other i i am 
that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss offered her the carriage and 
go very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now for he is a 
kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had
